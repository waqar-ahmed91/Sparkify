    "# Project Overview\n",
    "This project is all about analyzing and predicting the churn rate of the users from the data provided by a fictional music streaming company called 'Sparkify'. Users used this platform as a free member and paid member. While using the service data is generated in terms of playing a song, visiting a page etc.. According to the company some users downgraded their services from paid to free and some leave the services after using it for some time. So the main purpose of this project is to design a model that can predict the churn rate of the users according to the data provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Predict the churn rate of the users i.e if a user downgrade his/her services to free from paid subscription or leave the services/deactivate his/her account from the platform. For this purpose a machine learning model will be build from using different features to predict the churn of a new customer according to his/her activity while using the Sparkify platform.\n",

    "# Metrics\n",
    "f1-score (combination of precision and recall) is used to measure and evaluate the performance of the machine learning model on the dataset provided."
